# Venky060/OSPF-Multi-Area
🚀 Successfully Completed a Real-Time Enterprise–ISP Network Integration Project
 Technologies Used: OSPF | DHCP | BGP | ACL | GNS3
 Training: TungaBadra Networks
I’m excited to share that I have completed a real-time networking project where I built a full enterprise-to-ISP and cloud server setup using multiple routing and security technologies.
 This lab gave me a clear understanding of how real companies connect their internal network to ISPs and cloud platforms.
 
# 🔷 Project Overview
I designed an enterprise network (AS 100) and connected it to:
ISP – Airtel (AS 200)
Cloud Server Network (AS 300)
The goal was to simulate real-world communication between enterprise users, ISPs, and cloud services.
🔧 Technologies Implemented
 1. OSPF – Multi-Area Routing
Created and configured:
Area 0 (Backbone)
Area 18 (NSSA)
Area 20 (Stub Area)
This helped understand scalable routing inside enterprises.
 2. DHCP – Automatic IP Allocation
Branch PCs received IPs dynamically from the DHCP server, reducing manual work and supporting large networks.
 3. BGP – ISP & Cloud Connectivity
Configured:
eBGP with ISP AS 200 and Cloud AS 300
iBGP inside the enterprise
This allowed the enterprise to learn external routes and communicate with the cloud.
🔐 4. ACL – Cloud Server Access Control (Applied at Router R5)
I created an ACL on Router R5 to:
Allow only trusted networks
Block unwanted traffic
Stop cloud server access for selected enterprise networks
This gave me real experience in network security and traffic filtering.

This project helped me understand how networks run in telecom, banking, cloud, and large enterprises.

📌 Tools Used:
GNS3 • Cisco Routers • Cisco Switches • Cloud Server Simulation

🙌 Special Thanks:
TungaBadra Networks for the training and real-time guidance.
